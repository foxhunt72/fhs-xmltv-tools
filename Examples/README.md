## only_channels

Delete every channels that isn't mentioned
Maybe i am going to rename this to keep_channels

```

   command: only_channels
   store: tv
   channels:
    - RTL4.nl
    - RTL5.nl
```

## change_timezone

   replace: " +0200"
   store: tv
```

   command: add
   store: tv
   add_store: xmltv
```
